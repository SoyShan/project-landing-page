# project-landing-page
This is my first project of a landing page. My landing page was created for a cooking app called "Cookly" which does not exist, the name and logo was invented for the project.
The idea was to create a landing page to promote the paid version of the application.

ItÂ´s necessary download all of the sources of the repository to see the project.
